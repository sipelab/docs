### Friday
- Matlab2024 launches Widefield GUI but [[NI USB-6001]] not detected:
```Matlab
>> WidefieldImager
Unable to detect 'ni' hardware:
National Instruments NI-DAQmx driver is either not installed or the installed version is not supported.
Use the Windows Control Panel to uninstall any existing NI-DAQmx driver listed under 'National Instruments Software'.
Then, open the Add-On Explorer to install the Data Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for 
National Instruments NI-DAQmx Devices.

No NI devices found or data acquisition toolbox missing.
Use software triggers instead.
PCO camera not available. Searching for other cameras.
Using tucamimaq2016a64 as current video adapter
```
