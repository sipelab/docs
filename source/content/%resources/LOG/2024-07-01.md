# Notes
- Updating [[Napari]] launcher to record high frame rate acquisition
	- https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus/blob/main/examples/img_sequence_mda.py
	- [[PycroManager]] script for acquiring as fast as possible
	
	```python 
from pycromanager import Acquisition, multi_d_acquisition_events

with Acquisition('/Users/henrypinkard/tmp/', 'testacq', show_display=False) as acq:
  acq.acquire(multi_d_acquisition_events(num_time_points=10000))
  ```
- Committed to [[PyLab]] main a solution for increasing framerate acquisition by querying the memory buffer using [[pymmcore-plus]] with a while loop :
```python
def start_acquisition(num_frames, output_filepath):

    mmc.startContinuousSequenceAcquisition(0)
    time.sleep(1)  # Allow some time for the camera to start capturing images
    images = []

    for i in range(num_frames):
        while mmc.getRemainingImageCount() == 0:
            time.sleep(0.01)  # Wait for images to be available

        if mmc.getRemainingImageCount() > 0 or mmc.isSequenceRunning():
            image = mmc.popNextImage()
            images.append(image)

    mmc.stopSequenceAcquisition()

    # Save images to a single TIFF stack
    tifffile.imwrite(output_filepath, np.array(images), imagej=True)
```
- [x] With the new high_framerate_capture.py script, add GUI integration to visualize the capturing process in [[Napari 1]] script  [completion:: 2024-07-05]
