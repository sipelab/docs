When ChatGPT is used to create pages in this Obsidian vault, the document will contain a `Source` and `Prompt` property that details the prompt used with ChatGPT.

Nothing from ChatGPT is pasted raw, without my human intervention. ChatGPT is incapable of manifesting the vision of a prompt perfectly, and always requires touch ups to make sure that the output is was I intend. 

I will not prompt GPT to create a guide or tutorial on anything that I myself cannot or will not verify its integrity. GPT is used more as a tool for systematically creating solid documentation while my human intervention is to ensure it is viable and robust for real people to use!
