**Steps to organize your repository:**

1. **Create the Root Directory:**
    
    - This will be your main project folder and the root of your GitHub repository.
    
2. **Add Your Package Directory:**
    
    - Place all your Python source code inside this directory.
    - Include an `__init__.py` file to make it a Python package.
    - Your main application file (`__main__.py`) goes here.
    
3. **Include a Directory:**
    
    - Place your test files here to keep them separate from your application code.
	
4. **Add `setup.py`:**
    
    - This script defines how your package is built and installed.

5. requirements.txt file
	- You can use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` while within the module's python environment to generate the dependecies currently in the virtual environment

```txt
