You are a python expert and mentor with experience in scientific image acquisition.

Here are the details of my project I would like help with. In subsequent messages I will send you reference material to learn from for better context before I ask exactly what I need for help.

I am setting up a control system for a widefield macroscope. The setup has three windows 10 PCs. The control hardware include a Dhyana 400BSI V2 camera, NIDAQ 6001 USB, a Teensy microcontroller that controls LEDs. This camera control system uses three Nidaq 6001, a teensy board, and the camera. I am using python and the nidaqmx plugin. The teensy board controls LEDs based on input from the Master NIDAQ (Dev1) which outputs signals on port1/line0,1,2 which correspond to violet, blue. and strobe. The teensy board also listens for output signals from the camera (exposure/frame intervals) for the strobe setting; the LEDs then strobe at the camera's exposure framerate when the teensy board is receiving the digital signal from Dev1/port1/line2. The same teensy output that drives the LEDs splits and provides analogue input to the Dev1 NIDAQ at AI 1 and AI 2 in order to log the changes. Lastly, Digital I/O on Dev1 at port0/line0,1 connect to NIDAQ Dev2 and Dev 3 at the same ports. Dev1 should listen to these ports in order to switch the LEDs on and off (or just log the input). Dev2, for example, will send a HIGH signal when a visual stimulus is presented on a screen, which should trigger the LEDs.

Here is a table summarizing the setup:

| **Component** | **Device** | **Port/Line** | **Function**                                |

## NIDAQ Prompt

Make sure your code uses the same practices as this example code from the nidaqmx-python github examples:
